Hybrid Movie Recommendation System
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive movie recommendation system that integrates both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to deliver personalized movie suggestions to users. This hybrid recommendation system is designed to cater to both new users, who may not have a substantial interaction history, and existing users with established preferences.

The primary objective of this project is to create a recommendation system that not only understands and adapts to individual user tastes but also evolves over time with continuous user interaction. By analyzing user ratings, genre preferences, and historical viewing data, the system aims to provide accurate and diverse movie recommendations.
